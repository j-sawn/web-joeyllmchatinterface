## Purpose
I wanted to play around with the new UI, but I found that I couldn't make a new branch, so I just made this for myself to play around with (feel free to tell me to delete it if you want!)

## Instructions
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run dev`
* Open the appropriate localhost (usually `localhost:3000`)
