## Brief
I wanted to play around with the new UI, but I found that I couldn't make a new branch, so I just made this for myself to play around with (feel free to tell me to delete it if you want!)

This will show all proposed changes made to the current UI in the repository (in an effort to integrate the findings made by the Modelworks team)

## Instructions
* (FOR NEW USERS ONLY)
  * Clone this repository onto your local device
  * Through WSL, enter into your Python environment
    * If you haven't made one already: Run `python3 -m venv ./app/venv`
    * Run `source ./app/venv/bin/activate`
  * Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run dev`
* Open the appropriate localhost (usually `localhost:3000`)
